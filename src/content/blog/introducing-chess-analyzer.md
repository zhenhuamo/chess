# Introducing Chess Analyzer — a Free Chess Analysis Board That Runs Locally

Welcome to [Chess Analyzer](https://chess-analysis.org) — your home for fast, privacy‑first **chess analysis**. It runs entirely in your browser, powered by Stockfish, so you get instant evaluations without sign‑in and without uploading any games.

If you’re used to **lichess analysis** or **chess.com analysis**, you’ll feel right at home. The core features are familiar, with one big difference: everything runs locally. That means snappy feedback, fewer distractions, and no waiting for servers — truly **free chess analysis** on your device.

## What You Can Do

- Free chess analysis with Stockfish 17 running directly in your browser  
- An intuitive **chess analysis board** for stepping through ideas and blunders  
- Opening and position exploration with quick lines and model games  
- Import any PGN for full **chess game analysis**, then revisit it later from Records  
- Practice against the engine with controlled difficulty

In short: **analysis chess** tools you know — delivered locally, with a streamlined workflow.

## What Chess Analyzer Offers

- A clean, focused **chess analysis board** with multi‑PV, eval bar, and line browsing  
- One‑click import for PGN to run full **chess game analysis**  
- Position Explorer to study openings and model games — like a compact **lichess analysis board** experience  
- Play vs Engine to test ideas right away  
- Works anywhere: open your browser and continue where you left off

## Pain Points We Solve

- No account friction: get **chess free analysis** without sign‑in  
- No uploads: keep your games private while you experiment with **analysis chess**  
- No waiting: results are computed on your device, not queued on a server  
- No bloat: just the features you need to review lines and spot mistakes

## Why Choose Chess Analyzer

- Privacy‑first by design — analysis runs locally  
- Fast feedback loop for training and study sessions  
- Familiar workflow for users coming from **lichess analysis** or **chess com analysis**  
- Clear defaults for **chess engine analysis**, without configuration noise

## Compare With Lichess and Chess.com

Many players bounce between tools during training: **lichess analysis** to check a tactic, **chess.com analysis** to review a rapid game, a separate app for engine lines. Chess Analyzer unifies that workflow:

- A familiar **lichess analysis board** feel for quick browsing and candidate moves  
- **Chess board analysis** that highlights evaluation swings and key mistakes  
- **Chess engine analysis** configured for clarity: strong defaults, sensible limits  
- Portable: open your browser anywhere and continue

Use it alongside your favorite platform or as your primary analyzer — either way, it is designed to fit your routine.

## How It Works

Chess Analyzer uses WebAssembly builds of Stockfish to deliver fast, local compute. When you request an evaluation:

1. The engine spins up inside your tab (no server round‑trips).  
2. Multi‑PV lines populate as the search deepens.  
3. You can keep browsing, branch lines, or switch to another position.

Because it is local, you truly get **free analysis chess** — no quotas and no accounts. And since nothing leaves your device, your games remain private.

## Why Build Another Analyzer?

Two reasons:

1) Focus. A lot of “all‑in‑one” tools add friction. Chess Analyzer emphasizes a clean **chess analysis board** with just the controls you need.  
2) Portability. Training should not depend on a single service. With a local engine, you can analyze anywhere.

## Who Is It For?

- Players who want a free, capable **lichess analysis board** alternative  
- Coaches who need a lightweight tool for quick **chess board analysis** during lessons  
- Learners who value privacy and speed for everyday **chess engine analysis**

## Get Started

Visit https://chess-analysis.org — paste a PGN, or load the analysis board and make a few moves. Within seconds you’ll have practical lines and evaluations to guide your review.

Whether you call it “**chess analysis free**,” “**free analysis chess**,” or simply “**analysis chess**,” the goal is the same: clear feedback that helps you play better. Chess Analyzer gives you that feedback — fast, free, and on your device.
